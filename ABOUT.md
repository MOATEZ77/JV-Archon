# About JV-Archon

JV-Archon is my personal AI environment built for experimentation, coding,
reasoning, automation, and custom model behavior.

This project reflects how I design and run my local LLM setup across devices.
It includes my branding, structure, and ecosystem

## Why I built JV-Archon
- To understand LLMs deeply
- To optimize raw local models
- To build a personal offline AI
- To experiment with my own system behaviors
- To create a recognizable identity in AI development
